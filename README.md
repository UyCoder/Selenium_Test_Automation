# Selenium_Test_Automation
This project contains my learnings from a SDET bootcamp, including knowledge of UI automation frameworks, advanced webdriver techniques, and data structure and database concepts. It also includes three real-world automation projects: CubeCart automation, Sandbox automation, and Adobe Magento automation.

## Contents
`ui automation frameworks`: A directory containing notes and exercises on UI automation frameworks, including information on popular frameworks such as Selenium and Appium.
advanced-webdriver: A directory containing notes and exercises on advanced webdriver techniques, such as handling dynamic elements, working with JavaScript, and using the Page Object Model design pattern.
`data structure and jdbc`: A directory containing notes and exercises on data structure and JDBC concepts, including information on common data structures such as lists, queues, and stacks, and how to connect to and manipulate databases using JDBC.
`database utility`: A directory containing a database utility tool that can be used to perform common database tasks such as creating tables, inserting data, and executing queries.
`real-world projects`: A directory containing the three real-world automation projects, which demonstrate the use of Selenium and other tools to automate various web-based tasks. The projects include:
- CubeCart automation: A project that automates tasks on an e-commerce platform using Selenium and Java.
- Sandbox automation: A project that automates tasks on a sandbox environment using Selenium and Java.
- Adobe Magento automation: A project that automates tasks on a Magento platform using Selenium and Java.
